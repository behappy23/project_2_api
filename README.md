Project 2

  'AutoMainTain'
  I started planning for this project by creating user stories, wireframes and ERD.
  Technologies used was Ruby on Rails, Ruby.

  I began by scaffolding my resources into my project, making all my data catagories and to write curl scripts for all of my API requests. When I was able to get all of my curl scripts to succeed, I deployed my server and started on my front end.

Future outlook:
  I would like to create another table that is attached to each car that would display all the maintenance history.
Add a drop down menu of preloaded cars that you can add instead of adding each make and model
